# This is my first markdown language usage in github

With github, i am beginning to see the benefits of being an all round developer

## Markdown language just like no other

The use of **emphasis** markdown language **emphasis** as a new language makes me feel that there is better things ahead which i am yet to learn and know.  I used to believe that github was an easy to use **bold**platform**bold**, little wonder did i know that it was as complex but direct to use platform.  Today, only but a few nigerians make us of such a platform. Reasons being that we are lumped up with sourcing for source code instead of using the platform.
